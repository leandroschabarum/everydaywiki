After having access to your Virtual Machine (VM), usually as root,
it is advised to interact through a user with lower privileges with
your applications. To create such a user and give it 'sudo' privileges,
use the following commands.

	[~]# sudo su
	[~]# hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>
	[~]# vi /etc/hosts
		i ---> <ipaddress> TAB <hostname>
		ESC      ---> :wq

	[~]# adduser <new_user>
		fill in ---> press ENTER

	[~]# adduser <username> <group>
		group ---> sudo

Lists all available groups and users:

	[~]# cat /etc/group
	[~]# cat /etc/passwd

Lists log activities:

	[~]# cat /var/log/auth.log

If UFW is not installed, you are advised to do so because it greatly
simplifies dealing with firewall in linux.

	[~]# apt-get install ufw
	[~]# ufw default allow outgoing
	[~]# ufw default deny incoming
	[~]# ufw allow ssh
	[~]# ufw enable
	[~]# ufw status

*It is important NOT TO FORGET to explicitly allow connections for SSH
access, otherwise you will be locked out from your VM and will need
assistance from your hosting service provider getting it back!

Some basic update and upgrade procedures. Note that the 'do-release-upgrade'
can be done when a new version of the operational system is available.

	[~]# apt-get update
	[~]# apt-get upgrade -y
	[~]# apt-get autoremove

	[~]# ufw allow 1022/tcp comment 'Temporary tcp port 1022 for system upgrade over ssh connection.'
	[~]# do-release-upgrade
	[~]# uname -a
	[~]# lsb_release -a
	[~]# dmesg
	[~]# ufw delete allow 1022/tcp
	[~]# netstat -tulpn

Following up, it is a good idea to install GIT for your software deployment,
or even development if it so suits you.

	[~]# add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
	[~]# apt-get update
	[~]# apt-get install git

Next, you can install recently releases of Python through the 'deadsnakes'
repository.

	[~]# add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
	[~]# apt-get update
	[~]# apt-get install python3.8
	[~]# apt-get install python3.8-distutils
	[~]# apt-get install python3.8-venv
	[~]# apt-get install python3.8-dev
	[~]# python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

	[~]# python3.8 --version

Usually the system would already have prompted you to reboot, otherwise
it is a good idea to do so now.

	[~]# reboot
