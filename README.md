Swiss army knife of snippets and how-to guides for the everyday doubts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Working as a software developer and data analyst (specially coming from a mathematics background)
I've stumbled over some ridiculous and simple stuff that may come as obvious to most programmers
and IT professionals, but as a novice they were not that apparent at first glance.

After gaining a bit of experience ~~and making a lot of dumb mistakes,~~ it became clear that having
something as simple as GIT could be an awesome tool to also share some tips, tricks and guides about
our ~~un~~commonly doubts that may be hidden too many answers in on a _stackoverflow_ question post.

1. This is a personal (chosen to be made public) repository that is primarily used for taking notes
on things that come across once in a while, or are so recurrent that become worth writing down.
2. This repository consist of a miscellaneous assort of mostly text files that originally were put
together with no rigour at all.
3. **DO NOT** follow blindy **ANY** commands in here. **YOU ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
4. Bugs are most definitely something you're going to run into, not all answers are already found
and sometimes you got to do the hard work by yourself.
